*This project is a work in progress.*
Followed the [Learn Python for Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg) project by Siraj Rival to learn and practice Python data science skills. Completed 6 projects.

[Project 1:](https://github.com/redrainboot/data-science-proj/tree/main/project-1) Created a simple gender classfier with 4 different machine learning models in scikit. Trained and tested each model with a given data set and created data points to test the accuracy of each model. I tested 4 types of classifiers: binary tree, random forest, nearest neighbors, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. I found the Gaussian Naive Bayes model to be the most accurate with predicting gender after training with the given data set, and the nearest neighbors model to be the worst predictor of gender for this data set.
